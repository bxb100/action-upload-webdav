## :potted_plant: Details

### files

Use the [@action/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) to search for files matching glob
patterns. You can set multiple patterns.

<details>
<summary>Pattern Details</summary>

### Patterns

#### Glob behavior

Patterns `*`, `?`, `[...]`, `**` (globstar) are supported.

With the following behaviors:

- File names that begin with `.` will be included in the results
- Case-insensitive on Windows
- Directory separators `/` and `\` are both supported on Windows

#### Tilde expansion

Supports basic tilde expansion, for current-user HOME replacement only.

Example:

- `~` may expand to /Users/johndoe
- `~/foo` may expand to /Users/johndoe/foo

#### Comments

Patterns that begin with `#` are treated as comments.

#### Exclude patterns

Leading `!` changes the meaning of an include pattern to exclude.

Multiple leading `!` flips the meaning.

#### Escaping

Escape special glob characters by wrapping in `[]`. For example the literal file name `hello[a-z]` can be escaped as `hello[[]a-z]`.

On Linux/macOS `\` is also treated as an escape character.
